# ALAND's Hypixel SkyBlock Enchanted Books

This resource pack aims to give every enchanted book in Hypixel SkyBlock a unique texture to make them more recognizable and good-looking. ‚ú®

This is still a WIP project, which I aim to update frequently whenever I have time. Feel free to join the [Discord]([url](https://discord.gg/J6E8PDdeZj)) for sneak peeks and updates! üëÄ

P.S. This pack requires Firmament to work. Additionally, Firmament has an upcoming feature which will make the textures work in places like the Bazaar and Enchantments Guide menu, which will make the pack more useful!
